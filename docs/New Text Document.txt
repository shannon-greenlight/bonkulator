What if you had?

1. Configuration and performance scripts for your modules?
2. The ability to control your modules without having to weed through a forest of patch cords?
3. Modules that can react to events that occur anywhere in the world?
4. A community of enthusiasts who create a growing library of scripts and applications for your modules?

What Do You Get With Full Remote Control?

The short answer is "all this and more".

Greenface Labs builds modules that offer two types of remote control.

1. Terminal Access via USB
2. Web Access via WiFi

At their core, Greenface Labs modules process ascii character sequences as commands. These commands can come from the front panel as a result of button presses or trigger inputs. Commands can also come from the remote interfaces.
This means that anything that can be done from the front panel can also be done remotely and that many more things can be done remotely than can be done from the front panel.
This opens up a whold new world and once you've been there, you won't ever want to go back.
